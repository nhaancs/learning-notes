# Chap 2 - How we really use the Web

## I. Fact #1: We don't read the page, we scan them

- We're usually on a mission
- We know we don't need to read everything
- We're good at scan

=> We tend to focus on words and phrases that seem to match:

- The task at hand
- Our current or ongoing personal interests
- The trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous system, like "Free", "Sale" and "Sex", and our own name.

## II. Fact #2: We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice

We don't choose the best option, we choose the fist reasonable option:

- We're usually in a hurry
- There's not much of a penalty for guessing wrong
- Weighing options may not improve our chances
- Guessing is more fun

## II. Fact #3: We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through

- It's not important to us
- If we find something that works, we stick to it
