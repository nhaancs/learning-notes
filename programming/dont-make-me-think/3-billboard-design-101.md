# Chap 3 - Billboard design 101

Design for scanning, not reading

- Take advantage of conventions
- Create effective visual hierarchies
- Break pages up into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what's clickable
- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to support scanning

## I. Conventions are your friends

- **Where things will be located on a page**. For example, logo, search bar, site name, ...
- **How things work**. For example, ecommerce site all use shopping cart, same step to check out, ...
- **How things look**. For example, search icon, video icon, social networks sharing options, ...

## II. Create effective visual hierarchies

- The more important something is, the more prominent it is
- Things that are related logically are related visually (look the same)
- Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what

## III. Break up pages into clearly defined areas

Make it easier for scanning

## IV. Make it obvious what's clickable

## V. Eliminate distractions

There are 3 different kinds of noise:

- Shouting: When everything in the page is clamoring for your attention. The truth is, everything can't be important
- Disorganization
- Clutter: A page that have too much stuff. You must get rid of anything that's not making a real contribution

## VI. Format text to support scanning

- Use plenty of headings
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use bulleted lists
- Highlight key terms, but not too much
