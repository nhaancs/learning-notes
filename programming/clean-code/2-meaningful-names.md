# Meaningful names

## 1. Use Intention-Revealing Names

Name should tell why it exists, what it does and how to use it.

## 2. Avoid disinfomation

Example: accounts is a group of accounts while account just represents 1 account.

## 3. Make meaningful distintion

Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer. Example: avoid to declare 2 variables name `productInfo` and `productData`. Info and Data are indistinct noise words like `a`, `an`, and `the`.

## 4. Use pronounceable names

## 5. Use searchable names

Easy to guess and search the name.

## 6. Class Names

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account`, and `AddressParser`. Avoid words like `Manager`, `Processor`, `Data`, or `Info` in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

## 7. Method Names

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment`, `deletePage`, or `save`.

Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with `get`, `set`, and `is` according to the javabean standard.

When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments. For example, `Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);`

## 8. Pick One Word per Concept

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, itâ€™s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes.
